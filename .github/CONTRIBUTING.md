# Contributing to tmi.js

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

## What you should know before contributing

We have very precise rules with the way commit messages are formatted. Having commits formatted this way is more readable and easier when looking through the history of tmi.js.

### Commit message format

Each and every commit message must include a **scope** and a **subject** and your commit message **must be lowercase**:
* ``<scope>: subject``

The scope name is the filename without extension, and the subject is what you have changed / fixed in the code.
A few examples:

* ``client: your commit message here.``
* ``utils: your commit message here.``

## Coding style

We use double-quotes, indent with 4 spaces and use semicolons. Commenting your code is important, use single comments and make it short and clear.
